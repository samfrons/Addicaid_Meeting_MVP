	<h3>THE INDUSTRY</h3>
<p>The addiction treatment is virtually uncharted in the tech sector, and it is in dire need of this upgrade. It's a $30 billion a year industry while substance abuse and drug prevention costed the US Government $468 billion and both these numbers are only getting bigger.</p>

	<h3>THE URGENCY</h3>
<p>More than 23.5 million teenagers and adults suffer from addiction in the US alone and itâ€™s growing fast. Of the 1 in 10 who actually receive treatment, less than 5% remain drug and/or alcohol-free. The social toll is dire. 1 in 4 children have immediate family members in addiction and it is the driving force of homelessness.</p>
