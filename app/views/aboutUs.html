<div class="span3 person">
	<h4><span class="name">Sam Frons: founder</span><img src="../images/samcircle.png"/></h4>
	
<p>Sam has almost as many years of experience in UI/UX/art/design as she does binge drinking. She's been in recovery four 4 years and is an ardent supporter of The Technological Singularity, loves pool and ping pong and wants to return to competitive fencing- time permitting.

	<h4><span class="name"> Matt Kleiman: co-founder</span><img src="../images/mattcircle.png"/></h4>
	
<p>Matt has been a full-stack engineer for 9 years and has been sober for 7 of them, working at Morgan Stanley, Faceset, and the US Army. That said, he can regale tales of financial tactics and drama, (something here about factset), and the software secrets of the US Army. He also will rock your world in a game of Dungeons & Dragons.

	<h4><span class="name">Christian Flores: growth hacker</span>
	<img src="../images/christiancircle.png"/></h4>
<p>Christian only intended on coming to NYC for a weekend.  In 48 hours he found a job, an apartment, and subsequently never left.  Currently working as a web strategist in NYC, he doesn't have nearly as much time to flyfish and surf as he used to but he's working towards a guiding license to take people out fly fishing on weekends.</p>

<div class="span3 person">
	<h4><span class="name">Natalie Goodis: hustler</span>
	<img src="../images/nataliecircle.png"/></h4>
<p>Natalie is a Los Angeles native who now calls San Francisco home. She currently works at Facebook in Internal Communications and is excited to bring her experience running employee-facing communication channels to driving brand messaging and external PR for Addicaid. When not thinking about how technology can be harnessed to power social change, she likes riding her bike, drinking fancy coffee at Alamo Square picnics, and doing other stereotypically San Francisco activities. </p>

	<h4><span class="name">Thomas Levine: data consultant</span><img src="../images/tomcircle.png"/></h4>
	
<p>The addiction treatment is virtually uncharted in the tech sector, and it is in dire need of this upgrade. It's a $30 billion a year industry while substance abuse and drug prevention costed the US Government $468 billion and both these numbers are only getting bigger.</p>
